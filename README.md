Our Contributions:
- **Comprehensive CSLR Workflow Implementation**
<br>Successfully executed the complete workflow, including feature extraction, ISLR training, and online CSLR inference.
- **Training Process Optimization**
<br>Optimized the training pipeline. If you are experiencing long training times, you may refer to this repository for solutions. <font color="red">In our tests, we achieved approximately a 10x speedup</font>. On 8× Nvidia A100 GPUs, training for 100 epochs on the csl-daily dataset (using the same hyperparameters as the original paper) now completes in 10.79 days.
- **Keypoint Extraction Enhancement:**
<br>Enhanced the efficiency of keypoint extraction and resolved out-of-memory (OOM) issues during this stage, <font color="red">resulting in at least a 10% increase in processing speed</font>.
- **Extended Dataset Support**
<br>Conducted training experiments on the ce_csl dataset and also provided a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline for custom datasets.
